Aromatic terpenes signal the brain directly through the olfactory system.<\/strong><\/p><p>The key molecules in Bulgarian Rosa Damascena — citronellol, geraniol, and phenylethyl alcohol — are aromatic terpenes that travel through the olfactory pathways to the limbic system, particularly the amygdala and hypothalamus (the brain’s emotional and hormonal control centers).<\/p><p>When inhaled or absorbed through mucous membranes, these molecules trigger a parasympathetic (“rest-and-restore”) response — reducing sympathetic nervous activity and inhibiting excessive release of cortisol from the adrenal glands.<\/p><p>In short:<\/p><p>The aroma of rose communicates calm directly to the brain — before you even think it.<\/p><p><strong>2. Neurochemical modulation of serotonin and GABA.<\/strong><\/p><p>Studies show that rose essential oil components increase brain levels of serotonin (the “feel-good” neurotransmitter) and enhance GABAergic activity, which calms neuronal firing.<\/p><p>Higher serotonin and GABA both suppress overproduction of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) — the upstream signal that tells your body to make cortisol.<\/p><p><strong>3. Antioxidant polyphenols reduce physiological stress.<\/strong><\/p><p>Bulgarian rose petals also contain polyphenols like quercetin and kaempferol.<\/p><p>These compounds lower oxidative stress in the hypothalamus and adrenal tissue, stabilizing the body’s stress response and improving cortisol regulation over time.<\/p><p>This is why Rose Nectar produces both instant calm (via terpenes) and lasting balance (via antioxidants).<\/p>","text_size":"large","btn_title":"More on the Science","btn_link":"#","side_image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/left_img1_5b4f1317-cebf-46b0-9e2c-93fa82cdf0b4.png"}},"whats-inside-featured-content3":{"type":"whats-inside-featured-content3","settings":{"home_page_full_width":false,"section_title":"Ancient  Medicine & Energy Healing","text":"<p>Long before modern science named its terpenes and polyphenols, the Bulgarian Rose was revered as a plant of the heart — used for centuries in medicine, ritual, and energetic healing.<\/p><p>In ancient Persian, Greek, and Thracian traditions, rose petals and oils were used to cool the body, uplift the spirit, and open the heart.

After all, the Bulgarian Rose has been known and used for centuries for its unmatched skin benefits. So we asked ourselves, why does the world need another rose spray?! As we looked around, we realized that there are hundreds of rose water sprays. Most of them diluted, with preservatives, alcohol and long lists of questionable ingredients.  ackaged in clear plastic bottles, creating excessive environmental waste. So we decided to do something about it, and we took an unusual approach. We co-created Pure Rose Mist together with our customers! We asked many questions - and you gave us the answers. The result is the highest quality rose product you can find. Two ingredients only, the ones that matter - Pure Rose Nectar and organic rose oil. Amber glass spray bottle protecting against the effects of light. Refillable bottle so we can save you money and offer you more Rose instead of charging for wasteful packaging! <\/p>"}},"1593090667812":{"type":"tabs","settings":{"tab_title":"FAQ","tab_text":"<b>INGREDIENTS <\/b>\n<p class=\"end-p\">\nTwo ingredients only - Pure Rose Nectar and Organic Bulgarian Rose Oil.

Growing up, he\nwatched his parents take every morning a sugar cube with 2-3\ndrops of rose oil to boost brain health and prevent mental decline.\nHe tasked top Bulgarian scientists to develop an ingestible rose oil\nproduct. Skeptical at first, the scientists soon discovered that the\noil delivered on its great promise - it not only stimulated brain\nhealth, but also boosted heart cardiovascular health and showed\npotent anti-aging effects. They called it “the fountain of youth”.\nShortly after, Bulgaria launched a patented product with\nincredible results, and became a major export to wealthier\nnations. Yet, little did they know about vibrations at the time.\nThat product and the scientific research behind it inspired us to\ncreate Rose Yummies. After two years of research and\ndevelopment, we are thrilled to introduce to you the only Rose\nGummies in the world!
