(FAQ)","accordion-content":"<p><strong>🌿 USING & STORING<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>How should I store it?<\/strong><\/p><p>Keep your Rose Nectar in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.<\/p><p>Refrigeration isn’t required, but can help extend shelf life — especially once opened.<\/p><p>Most importantly, keep it somewhere you’ll see it and use it daily — your calm works best as a ritual, not an afterthought.<\/p><p><strong>Can I add it to hot drinks?<\/strong><\/p><p>Yes — the quality and benefits remain perfectly intact in both hot and cold beverages.<\/p><p>Add it to tea, matcha, or any warm drink and let the aroma bloom.<\/p><p><strong>Serving size<\/strong><\/p><p>Each serving is ¼ oz. We recommend at least 1 tablespoon daily (2 servings) — ideal for an 8–32 oz drink.<\/p><p>Adjust to taste and mood — lighter for a hint, richer for a deeper calm.<\/p><p><strong>How long does a 64 servings bottle last?<\/strong><\/p><p>Typically ~4 weeks, depending on how you enjoy it.<\/p><p>Some customers add it once a day to their favorite drink; others use it multiple times throughout the day.<\/p><p>Some prefer a light daily dose; others savor a richer blend for deeper calm & indulgence.<\/p><p><strong>🌸 PRODUCT & INGREDIENTS<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>What’s the difference between Rose Nectar and rose water?<\/strong><\/p><p>Most rose waters are generic — made for skincare or diluted drinks — and lack the full depth of the rose’s natural chemistry.<\/p><p><strong>Rose Nectar<\/strong> isn’t just different — it’s the only product handcrafted specifically for ingestion and emotional well-being.<\/p><p>It’s far richer in aromatic terpenes & antioxidant polyphenols, the compounds behind the rose’s calming, restorative power.<\/p><p>Each batch is crafted to deliver the perfect harmony of taste and aroma — a pure, concentrated expression of the Bulgarian rose in its most potent, delicious form.<\/p><p><strong>Does it contain sugar or additives?<\/strong><\/p><p>No. Rose Nectar has a very subtle natural sweetness from the rose itself — with no added sugar, preservatives, or artificial ingredients.<\/p><p><strong>What does “handcrafted” really mean?<\/strong><\/p><p>Each batch is made in small quantities from fresh Bulgarian Roses.<\/p><p>The flowers are at dawn during only 3 weeks per year in late spring and early summer, and gently extracted to preserve their aroma, nutrients, and calming energy.<\/p><p><strong>Can I mix it with other supplements or adaptogens?<\/strong><\/p><p>Yes — Rose Nectar pairs beautifully with most natural tonics, adaptogens, and wellness blends.<\/p><p>Its delicate floral flavor complements rather than overpowers, creating balance in every mix.<\/p><p><strong>Can I take it during pregnancy?<\/strong><\/p><p>We’re unable to provide medical advice.<\/p><p>Please consult your healthcare provider before using any botanical product during pregnancy.<\/p><p><strong>Is it safe for kids?<\/strong><\/p><p>Rose Nectar is made from pure, food-grade Rosa Damascena — a flower used in foods for centuries.<\/p><p>However, we recommend consulting your pediatrician before introducing any new botanical product to children.<\/p><p><strong>Can I be allergic to Rose Nectar?<\/strong><\/p><p>While true allergies to Rosa Damascena are rare, everyone’s body is unique, and sensitivities to botanicals can happen.<\/p><p>Rose Nectar is 100% pure and food-grade, with no synthetic additives — but if you have a history of floral or essential oil sensitivities, we recommend starting with a small amount first.<\/p><p>If you notice any reaction — such as redness, itching, or digestive discomfort — discontinue use and consult your healthcare provider.<\/p><p>Calm should always feel good — and your comfort comes first.<\/p><p>✨<strong> OREDERS & SUBSCRIPTIONS<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>What’s the best way to save?<\/strong><\/p><p>The best way to save — and to never run out of calm — is through a Rose Nectar subscription.<\/p><p>Subscribers always come first when quantities are limited.<\/p><p>It’s fully flexible — you can pause, cancel, or adjust your delivery frequency anytime with just a click.<\/p><p>Simple, stress-free, and designed to keep your calm ritual uninterrupted.<\/p><p><strong>How much is shipping?<\/strong><\/p><p>Shipping in the US is between $4.95 and $6.95.
