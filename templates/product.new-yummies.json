Curious, he asked top scientists to study it further.<\/p><p>Their discovery confirmed what tradition had long whispered: rose oil nourishes both body and mind. It supports brain health, heart function, and graceful aging — but it also restores something deeper — a calm state that allows the body to thrive.<\/p><p>They called it “the fountain of youth.”<\/p><p>We call it the power of calm.<\/p><p>That discovery inspired us decades later to reimagine the rose’s benefits for modern life — turning a centuries-old ritual into a delicious daily habit. After two years of research and development, we created Rose Yummies — the world’s first rose gummies, crafted to bring calm, beauty, and vitality together in every bite<\/p>","open":false}},"accordion_7gdBRq":{"type":"accordion","settings":{"accordion-heading":"FAQ","accordion-content":"<p><strong>What are Rose Yummies?<\/strong><\/p><p>Rose Yummies are the world’s first rose-infused gummies — a delicious daily ritual that delivers instant calm and sensory delight through the power of Bulgarian Rose Nectar and Rose Oil.<\/p><p><strong>What makes Rose Yummies unique?<\/strong><\/p><p>They’re designed to do what no other gummy does — calm your body and uplift your mood instantly, while delighting your senses.
